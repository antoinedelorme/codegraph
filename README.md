## 🚀 Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install Rust (skip if already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# 2. Clone and build CodeGraph
git clone https://github.com/antoinedelorme/codegraph
cd codegraph
cargo build --release

# 3. Start CodeGraph (auto-indexes + serves + watches)
./target/release/codegraph /path/to/your/project
```

**That's it!** Your AI assistant now has instant, real-time access to your codebase structure. 🎉

## 📖 What is CodeGraph?

CodeGraph is a **semantic code indexer** that gives AI agents instant access to your codebase structure through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of slow grep → read → parse workflows, AI can query semantic relationships in milliseconds.

### The Problem AI Agents Face

```
❌ Current AI workflow (45+ seconds):
   1. Grep for symbol across codebase (10s)
   2. Read and parse 8+ files manually (20s)
   3. Understand relationships and context (15s)
   4. Answer user question
```

### CodeGraph Solution

```
✅ With CodeGraph (<1 second):
   1. Query semantic index (0.05s)
   2. Get structured results with full context
   3. Answer user question instantly
```

**Result: 100x faster code navigation and understanding for AI agents**

### What CodeGraph Indexes

CodeGraph understands your code's **semantic structure**:
- **Functions & Methods** - What they do, what they call, who calls them
- **Classes & Types** - Inheritance, fields, relationships
- **Variables & Constants** - Usage patterns and scope
- **Imports & Dependencies** - How modules connect
- **Call Graphs** - Execution flow between components

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Real-time indexing** - Updates as you code (<50ms per file)
- 🧠 **Semantic queries** - Understands code structure, not just text
- 🔌 **MCP integration** - Works with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- 🌍 **Multi-language support** - Python, Rust, Go, Java, Intent
- 📊 **Impact analysis** - Predicts breaking changes before you make them
- 🔍 **Call graphs** - Traces execution paths between functions
- 💨 **Fast queries** - <100ms response time for most queries
- 🔒 **Local-first** - No cloud dependency, runs entirely on your machine
- ⚙️ **Configurable** - Customize indexing behavior per project

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+** (stable) - [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/antoinedelorme/codegraph
cd codegraph

# Build in release mode (recommended)
cargo build --release

# Optional: Install globally
cargo install --path .
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check version
./target/release/codegraph --version
# CodeGraph v0.1.0

# Check available commands
./target/release/codegraph --help
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

### Simple Mode (Recommended)

Start CodeGraph with a single command - it auto-indexes, serves via MCP, and watches for changes:

```bash
# Start in current directory
./target/release/codegraph .

# Start for a specific project
./target/release/codegraph /path/to/your/project

# Or use the explicit command
./target/release/codegraph start /path/to/your/project
```

**What happens automatically:**
- Indexes all supported files (Python, Rust, Go, Java, Intent)
- Starts MCP server (stdio transport for Claude Desktop)
- Watches for file changes and re-indexes automatically
- Ready for AI queries immediately

### Advanced Options

**Manual indexing (without serving):**
```bash
# Index current directory
./target/release/codegraph index

# Rebuild index from scratch
./target/release/codegraph index --rebuild

# Index without watching
./target/release/codegraph index --no-watch
```

**Serve without auto-indexing:**
```bash
# Use existing index (no auto-indexing)
./target/release/codegraph serve --project /path/to/your/project
```

**Query from command line:**
```bash
# Find all places that call a function
./target/release/codegraph query callers "authenticate_user"

# Find what functions are called by main()
./target/release/codegraph query callees "main"

# Find all references to a symbol
./target/release/codegraph query references "User.email"

# Show index statistics
./target/release/codegraph stats --verbose
```

**Analyze impact of changes:**
```bash
# What breaks if I rename this function?
./target/release/codegraph impact rename "old_function_name" --to "new_function_name"

# What breaks if I delete this class?
./target/release/codegraph impact delete "DeprecatedClass"
```

## 🔌 MCP Integration with Claude Desktop

CodeGraph integrates with Claude Desktop via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### Configure Claude Desktop

1. **Open Claude Desktop configuration:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   open ~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json

   # Linux
   nano ~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json

   # Windows
   notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. **Add CodeGraph to MCP servers:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "codegraph": {
         "command": "/full/path/to/codegraph/target/release/codegraph",
         "args": ["/path/to/your/project"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

4. **Test the integration:**
   - Ask Claude: *"What functions call the `authenticate` function?"*
   - Claude will use CodeGraph to instantly find the answer

### Example MCP Queries

Once integrated, Claude can answer questions like:
- *"Show me the call graph for the user authentication flow"*
- *"What would break if I rename `User.token` to `User.authToken`?"*
- *"Find all functions that handle HTTP requests"*
- *"What classes inherit from `BaseModel`?"*

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

CodeGraph supports project-specific configuration via `.codegraph.toml`:

```toml
# .codegraph.toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
root = "."

[languages]
# Which languages to index
enabled = ["python", "rust", "go", "java", "intent"]

[indexing]
# Exclude patterns
exclude = ["target/", "node_modules/", "**/__tests__/**"]
# Include only specific directories
include = ["src/", "lib/"]

[performance]
threads = 4
memory_limit = 500  # MB
```

Place `.codegraph.toml` in your project root for automatic loading.

---

## 🔌 MCP Integration

### Configure Claude Desktop

Edit `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/codegraph",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and CodeGraph will be available!

## 🌍 Supported Languages

CodeGraph currently supports **5 programming languages**:

| Language | Status | Parser | Features |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Python** | ✅ Production | tree-sitter-python | Functions, classes, methods, variables, imports |
| **Rust** | ✅ Production | tree-sitter-rust | Functions, structs, traits, impls, modules |
| **Go** | ✅ Production | tree-sitter-go | Functions, structs, interfaces, packages |
| **Java** | ✅ Production | tree-sitter-java | Classes, interfaces, methods, fields |
| **Intent** | ✅ Production | Custom regex parser | Contexts, fields, functions, inheritance |

### Why Intent is Special

**Intent is fully supported and available now!** 🎉

Intent is a domain-specific language designed for AI agents and semantic understanding. Unlike traditional programming languages, Intent focuses on:

- **Context hierarchies** - Organize concepts by domain/context
- **Semantic relationships** - Explicit relationships between concepts
- **Field-based modeling** - Data structures optimized for AI understanding
- **Function inheritance** - Behaviors that extend across contexts

**Example Intent code:**
```intent
context User {
    field id: String
    field email: String
    field role: String

    function authenticate(credentials: LoginCredentials) -> AuthResult
    function get_profile() -> UserProfile
}

context Admin extends User {
    field permissions: PermissionSet

    function manage_users(action: UserAction) -> Result
}
```

Intent files are indexed just like any other language - CodeGraph understands the context hierarchies, field relationships, and function calls.
